# Manaflair Toolbox Demonstration Project

[![](https://img.shields.io/david/manaflair/todo-demo.svg)]()

Each commit in this repository incrementally shows you how to build a functional todo-list by making use of the [Manaflair Toolbox](https://manaflair.github.io) modules. Some chapters have more than a single commit, feel free to subdivise them as you wish.

## Running locally

The application actually works! Just clone it and run `npm install`, then `npm start`. A webserver will be exposed using port [42000](http://localhost:42000).

## Chapters

- [**Chapter 1 : The beginning**](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/tree/chapter-1)

  We start with a clean-state application. It doesn't do anything else than serving a static site, but we don't really need anything more. That'll come later.

- [**Chapter 2 : Where we start modeling**](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/tree/chapter-2) ([diff](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/compare/chapter-1...chapter-2))

  Nothing too fancy here, we just create a few Sequelize models, and instruct Sequelize to use an in-memory database so that we don't have to deal with remote SQL servers. SQLite is awesome! Finally, we also setup a few fixtures.

- [**Chapter 3 : Where we start listening**](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/tree/chapter-3) ([diff](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/compare/chapter-2...chapter-3))

  The next step will require us to start exposing something to the world, via some kind of API. Conveniently, the Manaflair toolbox ships with [Json-Server](https://github.com/manaflair/json-server), a JSON-API-compatible server with out-of-the-box Sequelize support.

- [**Chapter 4 : Where we start talking**](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/tree/chapter-4) ([diff](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/compare/chapter-3...chapter-4))

  Now that we have someone to talk with, the only thing remaining is to speak to it. Serializing JSON-API data can be tricky, but we'll be using [Json-Talk](https://github.com/manaflair/json-talk), a toolbox that brings a lot of useful tools that you can use to fetch data from JSON-API-compatible APIs.

- [**Chapter 4b: Where we start working**](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/tree/chapter-4b) ([diff](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/compare/chapter-4...chapter-4b))

  Our application starts to look fine and dandy, but we're only fetching data, not creating new ones. Since we kinda need this feature for our todo-list, we will fix this by using the default Redux and Redux-Saga integrations shipped with Json-Talk. Less code, more time to watch Netflix. Count me in.

- [**Chapter 5 : Where we start waiting**](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/tree/chapter-5) ([diff](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/compare/chapter-4b...chapter-5))

  We're a bit hyperactive right now - we ask the server for data, but we proceed with rendering our pages before it even has a chance to answer. Maybe we could just wait a few milliseconds before transitioning? Come on, let's do this. Fortunately, [Async-Props](https://github.com/manaflair/async-props) got our back.

- [**Chapter 6 : The ending**](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/tree/chapter-6) ([diff](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/compare/chapter-5...chapter-6))

  For our final chapter, we'll do everything that isn't very important, but serves to smoothen the edges of our todo-list. Nothing too exciting, but you can give a look if you're curious.

Thanks for reading, I hope you've enjoyed this short tutorial of sort. If things are still unclear, check this repository's [issues](https://github.com/manaflair/todo-demo/issues) to see if we've been able to help someone else on this subject and, if not, feel free to open a new one. We will make sure to get back to you as soon as we can.
